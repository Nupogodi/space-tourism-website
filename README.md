## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to create a multipage website for a space tourism company that meets the following requirements:

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
## My process
- Research and planning
- Setting up the development environment
- Design and prototyping
- Building the components
- Integration
- Testing
- Deployment

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Modules
- Mobile-first workflow
- React Router
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned how to use React.js to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, managing the state of my components to create a smooth user experience. I also learned how to use React Router to handle navigation between different pages of the website.

I got to grips with CSS Modules and used them to write modular and maintainable styles for my components, which I used in conjunction with React.js to create a cohesive and attractive design for my website. I also learned how to use CSS custom properties and Flexbox/CSS Grid to create flexible and responsive layouts.

I used a mobile-first design approach to create a website that looks great on any device and used CSS media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

I used HTML5 to create well-structured and semantically meaningful content for my website and used semantic elements such as header, footer, main, and article to give structure to my pages.

I also learned how to use the browser's developer tools to debug my code and fix any issues, and how to use React's built-in testing features to ensure my components were working correctly.

Overall, I learned how to build a complete and professional-looking website using React.js and CSS Modules, and how to use these technologies to create a dynamic and responsive user interface that works well on any device.
